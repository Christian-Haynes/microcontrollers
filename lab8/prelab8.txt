1.  SPI0CFG is located on SFR Page 0 and is not bit addressable.
    SPI0CN is located on SFR Page 0 and is bit addressable.
    SPI0CKR is located on SFR Page 0 and is not bit addressable.
    SPI0DAT is located on SFR Page 0 and is not bit addressable.

2.  The setting that is necessary for SPI0CKR to set the data transfer rate to
    approximately 400KHz is:

    Since SYSCLOCK is set to 12.25MHz, Fsck = 400k = 12250000 / (2 *(SPI0CKR + 1))

    This results in SPI0CKR = 14.3125.

    Since we cannot have decimal numbers, we'll round down to 14. Therefore:

        SPI0CKR = 0x0E;

3.  The maximum clock you can get on SCK is one-half the system clock frequency or
    12.5 MHz, whichever is slower.

4.  Three-wire mode is set on the C8051 by setting the NSMD1 and NSMD0 bits to 0.
    Note that this must be set after the Master Mode Enable is set.

5.  We need to set those two ports to be push-pull. The individual pins that we will
    be using, needed to be logically anded with '1'. Additionally, both of those
    PMDOUTs are on SFR page 0x0F;
