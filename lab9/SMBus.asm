; modified from code from SiLabs, Copyright 2001 
;
; Example code to interface a single 256-byte EEPROM to a C8051F00x via the SMBus
; Code assumes a single EEPROM with  slave address 1010000 is connected on 
; the SDA and SCL lines, and no other masters are on the bus.
; 
; The SEND routine performs a 1-byte write to the EEPROM.  This consists of (1) START, 
; (2) slave address + W, (3) memory location byte write, and (4) a data byte write.
; 
; STEPS FOR WRITING TO EEPROM:
;   1) Load slave address into SLA_ADD
;   2) Load memory address into MEM_ADD
;   3) Load data byte into TRANSMIT_BYTE. 
;   4) Call SEND
;
; The RECEIVE routine performs a 1-byte read from the EEPROM. This consists of (1)
; START, (2) slave address + W, (3) memory location byte write, (4) repeated START,
; (5) slave address + R, (6) data byte read.
;
; STEPS FOR RECEIVING DATA:
;   1) Load slave address into SLA_ADD
;   2) Load memory address into MEM_ADD
;   3) Call RECEIVE
;   4) Read RECEIVE_BYTE
;
; The SMBus state table is broken into 8-byte state segments, allowing the SMBus 
; status code (SMB0STA) to be used as a state index.  Note that this leaves only
; 8 bytes of code space per SMBus state definition. As a result, certain tasks
; have been altered to limit state definition lengths:
;
; 1) The SMB_MTDBACK state (Master transmitter, data byte sent, ACK received) is 
; reduced to a bit-check and branch operation.  The branch is outside of the state 
; table, so that a larger code segment may be executed for this state. 
;
; 2) Three data bytes are used for slave address storage: SLA_ADD, WRI_ADD, READ_ADD.
; Rather than using bit-wise operations in the SMBus states, each transfer routine 
; pre-loads the address values.  Since a RECEIVE includes both a WRITE and READ
; transfer, two address bytes are necessary - WRI_ADD and READ_ADD.  SLA_ADD is used
; as a generic slave chip select before a function call. 
;
; Note that SLA_ADD is equivalent to WRI_ADD, since WRI_ADD = SLA_ADD + W (W=0). 
; The two are left separate to clarify the demonstration.
