Prelab #6 - DAC pt. 2
2012-10-29

1.	The 12 bits of data are stored in the 16 bits of DAC0/DAC1 data SFRs
	by the following:

	In DACnCN register, there lower 3 bits control the data format for the dac.
	You can set it up so that you can pack the 12 bits with the LSB in the
	LSB location in the DACnL SFR. This makes the most significant nibble in
	the first 3 bits of DACnH.

	There are 4 other modes and they appear to be a shifting of the data in the
	DACn data SFRs.

2.	Addresses: (from page ~148)

	DAC0L 	0xD2 #SFR Page 0
	DAC1L 	0xD2 #SFR Page 1
	TMR2L	0xCC #SFR Page 0
	RCAP2L	0xCA #SFR Page 0
	DAC0H	0xD3 #SFR Page 0
	DAC1H 	0xD3 #SFR Page 1
	TMR2H	0xCD #SFR Page 0
	RCAP2H	0xCB #SFR Page 0

3a.	Perhaps to adjust the volume we can just multiply the sound data by a
	scalar. To adjust the balance we can just multiply one channel and leave the
	other channel alone.

3b. To adjust the volume via the DAC, we just multiply by shifting to the left.
	A similar thing can be done for the balance, where we would shift 1 channel
	or the other. Where channel is either DAC0 or DAC1.
